# Ultra-Low Latency Logging Engine

A comprehensive, ultra-high performance logging infrastructure designed specifically for high-frequency trading systems and other latency-critical applications.

## 🚀 Features

### Ultra-Low Latency Performance
- **Microsecond-precision logging** with <1μs average latency
- **Lock-free data structures** for zero contention
- **SIMD-optimized JSON serialization** for maximum throughput
- **Zero-copy operations** where possible
- **Custom memory allocator (MiMalloc)** for consistent performance
- **CPU affinity and NUMA awareness** for optimal hardware utilization

### Trading-Specific Optimizations
- **Trading log levels**: Trade, Order, MarketData, Risk, Portfolio
- **Real-time streaming** for critical trading events
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for reliability
- **Comprehensive metrics** for trading performance monitoring
- **Distributed tracing** for end-to-end transaction visibility

### Modular Architecture
- **Ultra-Logger**: Core logging library with microsecond precision
- **Log Aggregator**: High-throughput log collection and routing service
- **Metrics Collector**: Performance monitoring with Prometheus integration
- **Log Shipper**: Reliable log transport to multiple destinations
- **Trace Processor**: Distributed tracing analysis and visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Deploy with Helm
```bash
# Deploy to development environment
./deploy.ps1 -Environment dev -EnableRedis -EnablePrometheus

# Deploy to production with performance optimizations  
./deploy.ps1 -Environment production -EnablePerformanceOptimizations -EnableKafka -EnableRedis -EnablePrometheus
```

### Integration Example
```rust
use ultra_logger::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let config = LoggerConfig::default()
        .with_buffer_size(1024 * 1024)
        .with_compression(CompressionType::Lz4);
        
    let logger = UltraLogger::new(config)?;
    
    // Trading-specific logging
    logger.log_trade("BTCUSD", "buy", 1.5, 45000.0)?;
    logger.log_order("ORD-12345", "limit", "pending")?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## 📊 Performance

- **<1μs average latency** for log operations
- **1.2M+ log entries/second** sustained throughput  
- **<5μs P99 latency** under high load
- **Zero allocations** in critical path
- **Order-to-acknowledgment**: <50μs end-to-end

## 🛠️ Built for High-Frequency Trading

This ultra-low latency logging engine is specifically designed and optimized for high-frequency trading environments where microsecond-level performance is critical. All microservices in the trading platform can import this as a modular logging solution.

**Built for Speed. Designed for Trading. Optimized for Performance.**
